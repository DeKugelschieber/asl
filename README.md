# ASL

ASL stands for Arma Scripting Language, a C-style scripting language compiled to SQF.
ASL is intended to simplify Arma 3 mod and mission development and eliminate the pain of SQF's bad syntax.

Main reasons for ASL:

* consistent and clean syntax
* less writing
* easier to read and maintain
* easy to lern and understand
* full replacement of SQF
* compatible with Arma wiki and commands

The compiler is written in Go and implemented as a simple recursive decent parser and uses concurrency to compile multiple files at once, which makes it really fast.

## Syntax
